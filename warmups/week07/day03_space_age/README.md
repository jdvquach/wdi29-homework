# Space Age Warmup

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

   - Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
   - Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
   - Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
   - Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
   - Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
   - Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
   - Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
   - Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old,
you should be able to say that they're 31 Earth-years old,
and their age on the above planets would be as follows:

- Mercury years: 131.56953287725742
- Venus years: 51.50882468824545
- Mars years: 16.848054878116695
- Jupiter years: 2.6712565327315225
- Saturn years: 1.0760876124018737
- Uranus years: 0.37716350140100413
- Neptune years: 0.1922922142624317



There are 31557600 seconds in an Earth year.

### Bonus:

Have the option of either returning the ages on all planets, or any of the above planets individually.
