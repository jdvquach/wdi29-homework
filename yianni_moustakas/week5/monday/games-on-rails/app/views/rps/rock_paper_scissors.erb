<!-- # __Rock Paper Scissors__
#
# * Create a route that goes from ```/games/rock_paper_scissors/:throw``` to ```rps#play```
# * Use params[:throw] as a user's choice
# * Compare the 2! If  users throw matches the apps throw, the user wins.
# * i.e. If a user throws rock ```http://localhost:3000/games/rock_paper_scissors/rock``` and the server picks rock player wins! (Yes,  I know that is not how RPS works)
# Bonus: Set the win or lose condition based on the real rules of [Rock Paper Scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors). -->
